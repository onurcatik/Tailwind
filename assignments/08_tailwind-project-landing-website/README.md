# Landing Website with Tailwind CSS

## **Objective:**

The goal of this assignment is to create a responsive **Landing Website** using **Tailwind CSS**. The website will consist of sections such as Navbar, Hero Section, Services, Team, Pricing, Contact Us, and Footer. Each section should be carefully designed to attract and engage visitors, with a focus on visual appeal, responsiveness, and functionality.

This project will help you practice structuring a professional landing page while learning to implement Tailwind CSS utilities to style each component efficiently.

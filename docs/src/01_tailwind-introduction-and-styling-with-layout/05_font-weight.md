# Understanding Font Weight in Tailwind CSS

In addition to adjusting font sizes, **font weight** is another crucial aspect of typography in web design. Tailwind CSS provides several utilities to help you control the weight of text, allowing you to emphasize or de-emphasize certain elements on your page. This chapter will walk you through how to use Tailwind's font-weight utilities, explore best practices, and highlight common use cases for these typography settings.

## 1. Introduction to Font Weight in Tailwind CSS

Font weight refers to the thickness of characters in a font family. This property can be used to create a visual hierarchy, allowing users to differentiate between headings, subheadings, body text, and other content types.

Tailwind CSS provides a range of **font weight utilities**, which can be applied to any text element by adding classes like `font-bold` or `font-light` directly to your HTML.

**Common Font Weight Classes**:
- `font-thin`: Thin (100)
- `font-extralight`: Extra Light (200)
- `font-light`: Light (300)
- `font-normal`: Normal (400)
- `font-medium`: Medium (500)
- `font-semibold`: Semi-Bold (600)
- `font-bold`: Bold (700)
- `font-extrabold`: Extra Bold (800)
- `font-black`: Black (900)

Each class provides a simple and intuitive way to control the weight of your text.

## 2. Using Font Weight Utilities (Example)

Tailwind's font weight utilities are easy to implement. Simply use the `font-` prefix followed by the desired weight keyword.

### HTML Example with Tailwind Font Weight Utility
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <link href="output.css" rel="stylesheet">
    <title>Tailwind CSS Font Weight Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p class="font-bold">This is bold text.</p>
    <p class="font-normal">This is normal text.</p>
    <p class="font-semibold">This text has semi-bold weight.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### Output:
- The first paragraph will appear bold, as it uses the `font-bold` utility.
- The second paragraph will appear with normal weight, using the `font-normal` utility.
- The third paragraph will appear semi-bold, using the `font-semibold` utility.

## 3. Customizing Font Weights

Tailwind comes with a set of predefined font weights, but if you need more customization, you can modify or extend the default values in the `tailwind.config.js` file.

### Example of Custom Font Weight in `tailwind.config.js`:
```js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      fontWeight: {
        'extra-thick': '950',
      },
    },
  },
}
```

After this configuration, you can use the `font-extra-thick` class in your HTML to apply the new font weight.

### Example:
```html
<p class="font-extra-thick">This is extra-thick text with a weight of 950.</p>
```

## 4. Responsive Font Weight

One of Tailwind's strengths is its flexibility with responsive design. Just like with font sizes, you can adjust font weights based on screen size by combining the font weight utility with responsive prefixes such as `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, and `xl:`.

### Example of Responsive Font Weight:
```html
<p class="font-normal md:font-bold">
  This text is normal weight on small screens, and bold on medium screens and up.
</p>
```

In this example:
- On small screens, the text will have normal font weight.
- On medium screens and larger (like tablets and desktops), the text will switch to bold.

## 5. Best Practices for Using Font Weight in Tailwind CSS

### Establishing Hierarchy:
Font weight is often used to establish a visual hierarchy within text content. Headers and titles typically use heavier font weights to draw attention, while body text remains lighter for readability.

### Consistency is Key:
When using font weights, consistency across similar elements (such as headings) is important to maintain a cohesive design. Stick to a clear pattern of font weights to avoid visual confusion.

### Combining with Other Typography Utilities:
Font weight can be used alongside other Tailwind typography utilities such as **font size**, **line height**, and **text decoration** for a well-rounded approach to styling.

## 6. Common Pitfalls

While using Tailwindâ€™s font-weight utilities is generally straightforward, there are a few pitfalls to avoid:

- **Overuse of Bold Text**: Bold text is best reserved for emphasis. Overusing bold styles can reduce readability and make your design feel heavy.
- **Lack of Contrast**: If the difference between font weights is too subtle, users may not notice the hierarchy or emphasis you are trying to create. Be sure the font weights you choose offer clear differentiation.
- **Responsive Misalignment**: Ensure that your font weights are optimized for all screen sizes. For example, what works for a large desktop screen may be too heavy or too light on mobile.

## 7. Real-World Use Cases

Here are some practical use cases for different font weights:

- **Headers & Subheaders**: Use `font-bold` or `font-extrabold` for headings to create a clear hierarchy.
- **Body Text**: Stick with `font-normal` for most body text to keep it legible and easy on the eyes.
- **Call-to-Action (CTA) Buttons**: Use `font-semibold` or `font-bold` on buttons to make them stand out.
- **Accents & Highlights**: You can use `font-light` for less important or secondary content to provide subtle emphasis.

### Example:
```html
<h1 class="font-extrabold text-4xl">Main Heading</h1>
<h2 class="font-bold text-2xl">Subheading</h2>
<p class="font-normal text-base">This is some body text for the paragraph.</p>
<button class="font-semibold text-lg">Call to Action</button>
```

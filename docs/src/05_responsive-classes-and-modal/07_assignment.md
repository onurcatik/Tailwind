# Interactive Dashboard with Tailwind CSS and JavaScript

## **Objective:**

The objective of this assignment is to create an interactive and fully responsive dashboard using a component-based approach. You will implement reusable components with Tailwind CSS, integrate breakpoints and media queries for responsiveness, and utilize JavaScript to create interactive elements such as sidebars, dropdowns, and modals.

## **Requirements:**

1. **Use Tailwind CSS for Styling:**
   - Utilize Tailwind CSS for all styling, including layout, typography, and component design.
   - Apply utility classes, breakpoints, and responsive classes to ensure the dashboard adjusts to different screen sizes.

2. **Design a Responsive Layout:**
   - Begin by designing the layout for a dashboard that adapts to different devices, including mobile and desktop views.
   - Implement a **mobile-first design approach** with easy navigation and smooth transitions.

3. **Implement Reusable Components:**
   - Create reusable components such as a **sidebar**, **navbar**, **footer**, **statistics cards**, and **charts** using Tailwind CSS classes and the `@apply` directive for custom classes.

4. **Incorporate Interactive Elements with JavaScript:**
   - Add interactive features such as **dropdowns**, **collapsible sidebars**, and **modals** using JavaScript.
   - Ensure smooth opening and closing animations with Tailwindâ€™s transition classes (`transition`, `duration-300`).

5. **Apply Responsive Design Techniques:**
   - Utilize breakpoints (`sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`) and media queries to make the dashboard fully responsive.
   - Implement **grid** and **flexbox** layout strategies for smooth adaptability across various screen sizes.

6. **Add Data Visualization:**
   - Integrate simple charts or graphs using a charting library (such as **Chart.js**) to visually represent data on the dashboard.
   - Style the charts with Tailwind utilities and customize them for both dark and light themes.

## **Submission:**

1. **HTML File:**
   - Submit a single HTML file named `index.html` that contains the code for your Tailwind CSS project, along with the interactive elements created with JavaScript.

2. **CSS File:**
   - Include a CSS file named `styles.css` where you will add the necessary Tailwind CSS classes and any custom styles.

3. **JavaScript File:**
   - Add a JavaScript file named `app.js` that handles the interactive elements, such as modals, dropdowns, and sidebars.
